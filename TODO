# FIXME
ðŸŸ¢ Instead of raw strings for keys, use hashes.

ðŸŸ Make the performance better for the KV storage engine that we use, lookups take awfully long. 

ðŸ”´ Jena Streams may encounter a fatal error when reading and shutdown the program.

# NOTES
First batch of 5 million URIs took around ~5 minutes to complete with my specs, and it took another hour to complete the next 9 batches, meaning it took 1 hour for about 50 million URIs, which I believe is awfully slow!!!

# COMPLETED TASKS
- Add a better logger backend to not just print the stuff in the console
