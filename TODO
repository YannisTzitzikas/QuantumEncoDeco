# FIXME
ðŸŸ¢ Add a better logger backend to not just print the stuff in the console

ðŸŸ¢ Instead of raw strings for keys, use hashes.

ðŸŸ Make the performance better for the KV storage engine that we use, lookups take awfully slow. 

ðŸ”´ Jena Streams Run out of memory, which they shouldn't do, either when they ve run for a long time (not sure about that) or when the computer goes to sleep mode in the middle of the encoding process and thus the execution stopped. 

# NOTES
First batch of 5 million URIs took around ~5 minutes to complete with my specs, and it took another hour to complete the next 9 batches, meaning it took 1 hour for about 50 million URIs, which I believe is awfully slow!!!
