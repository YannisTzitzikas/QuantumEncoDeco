# FIXME
ðŸŸ¢Currently all edges just broadcast things which make the system more simple yet more rigid at the same time. Think of some good Edge policies. Think of a way to pass on specific edges only Messages and not broadcast them all the time. This will make the system more complicated due to the fact that we would need to think of a way to pass the emission conditions. A small DSL would be ideal but this is not urgent. 

ðŸ”´ Jena Streams may encounter a fatal error when reading and shutdown the program. Find a Recovery mechanism.

# NOTES
First batch of 5 million URIs took around ~5 minutes to complete with my specs, and it took another hour to complete the next 9 batches, meaning it took 1 hour for about 50 million URIs, which I believe is awfully slow!!!

# COMPLETED TASKS
- Add a better logger backend to not just print the stuff in the console
- Think of a better way to abstract this and build up the stage catalog
- Enrich configuration system
